# normalize.sass v2

Normalize.sass is a rewrite of the most excellent Normalize.css using the sass
syntax. Why does it exist? Because before it DID exist, it was busy trying to
avoid the problematic position of not un-existing.

To put it plainly, it doesn't not exist anymore.


# The Original

Normalize.css was created by @necolas and is pretty great. I highly suggest that
you go over to his [original repository](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css)
if you'd like to use Normalize as part of your toolkit. He's even got fancy
[bower](http://bower.io) nonsense going on.

You can also [Check out the demo](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/latest/test.html)
and find [Legacy browser support is available in v1](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/tree/v1)
